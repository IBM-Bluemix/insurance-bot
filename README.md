## Running the app on Bluemix
<Either add a Deploy to Bluemix button or include detailed instructions on how to deploy the app(s) to Bluemix after cloning the repo. You should assume the user has little to no Bluemix experience and provide as much detail as possible in the steps.>

Coming Soon!

[Sign up for Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration) in the meantime!

<Create sub-sections to break down larger sequences of steps. General rule of thumb is that you should not have more than 9 steps in each task. Include sanity checks, or ways for the developer to confirm what they have done so far is correct, every 20 steps. Also, avoid directly referencing the Bluemix UI components so that ACE changes don't invalidate your README.>

## Run the app locally

1. Create a Compose for MongoDB service in Bluemix

  ```
  cf create-service compose-for-mongodb Standard insurance-bot-db
  ```

1. Create a Conversation service in Bluemix

  ```
  cf create-service conversation standard insurance-bot-conversation
  ```

1. In the checkout directory, copy the file ```vcap-local.template.json``` to ```vcap-local.json```. Edit ```vcap-local.json``` and update the credentials for the MongoDB and Conversation services. You can retrieve the service credentials from the Bluemix console.

  ```
  cp vcap-local.template.json vcap-local.json
  ```

1. In the checkout directory, copy the file ```.template.env``` to ```.env```. Edit ```.env``` and update the credentials for the MongoDB and Conversation services.

  ```
  cp .template.env .env
  ```

1. Run

  ```
  npm install
  ```

1. Run
